# Demo project for Python-Introduction course

This project resembles a small, untested library for Python that has the
following caveats

1. no setup.py

2. no unit tests for code (of which there isn't much)
  * code intentionally has bugs
3. no style checking done
4. different behaviour in different Python versions (so testing with tox might
be a good idea)
